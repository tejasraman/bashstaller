## Simple, Shell Script powered Linux installers
**WARNING: These scripts are still a work in progress. I am not responsible for any damage caused to your system by these scripts. Many of the scripts are specific to a certain manager/Linux distro.**

These installers use the power of shell scripting to create a powerful, GTK-centric installer mechanism for any Linux distro (macOS coming soon). 

### Requires:
* zenity (any version)

Future versions of the script will include a way to add dependencies for installation.

### TODO:
* Make from-source installers
* Make a way to store file contents inside script for static binaries
* Make a wxWidgets version for easy use with cython to create a fully platform-native/binary installer

### Credits:
* GNOME for zenity
(that's it for now)
